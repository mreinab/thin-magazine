    <strong>[THIN] Can you tell us a bit about your background and how you got into photography?</strong><br>
    [VV] I grew up in Ukraine, surrounded by nature and the small details of everyday life. Photography became a way for me to explore and capture moments that might otherwise go unnoticed. I started with landscapes but quickly fell in love with still lifes and capturing the essence of objects during my travels.

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] Your work often focuses on still lifes. What draws you to this style?</strong><br>
    [VV] Still lifes allow me to slow down and observe the subtle beauty of everyday objects. When I travel, I look for natural arrangements—fruits, flowers, or textures—that tell a story about the place I'm in. Each composition is a moment frozen in time, a reflection of both nature and human interaction.

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] How do your travels influence the way you photograph?</strong><br>
    [VV] Traveling exposes me to different cultures, colors, and atmospheres. I often find inspiration in local markets, traditional kitchens, or natural landscapes. The objects I photograph carry the memory of the place, and I aim to translate that feeling into my compositions.

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] What is the philosophy behind your approach to light and texture?</strong><br>
    [VV] Light is everything in my photography. I try to capture it naturally, using shadows and highlights to give depth. Texture adds a tactile dimension, making the viewer feel the surface of objects, almost as if they could reach out and touch them. This approach makes my images intimate and immersive.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] Your still lifes often include fruits and plants. Is there a particular reason for this choice?</strong><br>
    [VV] Nature has an inherent rhythm and simplicity that fascinates me. Fruits, leaves, and flowers have shapes, colors, and imperfections that make them perfect subjects. They are a metaphor for life itself—beautiful, fleeting, and full of character.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] Do you plan your compositions in advance or work spontaneously?</strong><br>
    [VV] Both, actually. Sometimes I set up a scene with careful attention to detail, but often I prefer spontaneity. When traveling, I discover objects and moments that I cannot stage. Those unplanned encounters often result in my most honest and compelling images.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] What has been your most memorable project so far?</strong><br>
    [VV] I would say my recent journey through the Carpathian mountains. I photographed local markets and kitchen tables, capturing still lifes that reflected daily life in small villages. The combination of natural light, handcrafted items, and local produce made it a unique and unforgettable experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>[THIN] Finally, what advice would you give to aspiring photographers?</strong><br>
    [VV] Be patient and observe. Travel, explore, and never underestimate the beauty of simple things. Focus on what moves you personally, and your passion will translate into your work. Remember, the smallest detail can tell the largest story.
